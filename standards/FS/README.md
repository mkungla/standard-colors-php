# The Federal Standard color system

The Federal Standard color system, officially named Federal Standard 595C - Colors Used in Government Procurement, 
is a United States Federal Standard, issued by the General Services Administration. It is last revised in 2008. 
The standard is also widely referred to as FED-STD-595, FS-595, or similar names with the version letter appended. 
The standard is built upon a set of color shades where a unique reference number is assigned to each color. 
Each color in the Federal Standard 595C range is identified by a five-digit code. 
The colors in the standard have no official names.
