# The Pantone Colour Matching System

The Pantone Colour Matching System is largely a standardized colour reproduction system. 
By standardizing the colours, different manufacturers in different locations can all 
refer to the Pantone system to make sure colours match without direct contact with one another. 
The Pantone Matching System (PMS) is a proprietary colour space used in a variety of industries, 
primarily printing, though sometimes in the manufacture of coloured paint, fabric and plastics.  
The Pantone colour guides have been widely adopted and are used by artists, designers, printers, 
manufacturers, marketers and clients in all industries worldwide for accurate colour identification, 
design specification, quality control and communication.
